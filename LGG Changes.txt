Linuxgurugamer Changes

Bug:
	Four GameEvent callbacks weren't being released upon leaving the flight scene.  These were memory leaks and could cause other problems

Fix
	In the RPMVesselComputer.cs, in the OnDestroy method, remove the check for scene == FLIGHT.  Not needed since this can only be called when in flight, and by the time the OnDestroy is called, it isn't in flight anymore
	in the RPMVesselComputer.cs, in the OnDestroy method, moved check for vessel == nul to AFTER the removal of the callbacks from the GameEvents
