### Warning

Some props that were previously part of RPM have been moved to ASET Consolidated Props Pack. If you are using IVAs that use those props, you'll need to make sure to switch to that version. If you're using CKAN, simply update RPM and ASET Props and you're good to go.

- Moved thrust reverser patches from ASET
- Fixed "double-vision" bug that could occur when going EVA while an external camera was active

## 0.31.6 - 2022-01-15

### Changes

- Reworked parachute actions:
  - Clicking the "Deploy" button now sets the minPressure to minimum, safety mode to "unsafe," and arms the chute. In other words, it tries to immediately deploy the chute.
  - Clicking "Arm" simply arms the chute
  - Clicking "Disarm" disarms the chute and sets the safety mode to "when safe."
- Added timewarp button support  
  "Warp to Next" button will warp to the next maneuver node, SOI change, PE, or AP depending on context

### Changes

- Update compatibility to ksp 1.12
- Merge PRs related to camera drag cube & ascending node calculation
- Fix ATMOSPHEREDEPTH variable
- Fix SAS mode strings in ASET MFDs
- Fix radial in/out swapping on SAS mode buttons
- Fix Mechjeb integration with latest MJ version


## 0.31.4 - 2020-07-12

Remove dependencies on flight UI elements, because they no longer update when not visible in KSP 1.10. Specifically this fixes navball orientation and atmosphere depth gauge when in IVA, and any variables derived from those inputs.

This same release is likely compatible with KSP 1.8.x and 1.9.x, but I have not tested it (and there's no reason you should need this one if you're not on KSP 1.10).

Many thanks to Manul and Zorkinian on the KSP forums for pinpointing the root cause!


## 0.31.3 - 2020-02-23

### Changes

- Updated external camera code for the new camera system in 1.9. This is on a runtime switch so this release is compatible with 1.8 and opengl in 1.9.


## 0.31.2 - 2020-01-22

### Changes

- CKAN is now officially supported. There are 2 CKAN packages, see the readme for details.

- Fix vessel recovery prop soft-locking the game in some circumstances
- Add missing vessel types to target menu
- Fix some debug-only errors
- Fix null reference exception on revert to editor
- Add compatibility patches for incorrectly configured mods (NMB and OPT specifically)
- Fix null reference exception when using internal light switch on incorrectly configured cockpits
- External camera pages default to skip missing cameras, so the ALCOR MFD landing page will start on ExtCam1 if it exists
- Move variable handler for plugins before builtins like it says in the docs
- Fix line drawing on NAV pages due to broken shader reference in scansat


## 0.31.0 - 2019-12-29
